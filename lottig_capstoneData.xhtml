         <li>Question 14: What did you learn of the Troubles from the previous answers you selected
            above?:  I did history up until JC but I didn't enjoy it and I rarely paid any attention

         <li>Question 16: In your opinion, should there be a Peace Wall?  Why or why not?:  I don't
            know if it prevents trouble or creates it. I don't know enough about it to say honestly
            but I feel like it could potentially create a lot of stigma around it and provoke
            a lot of violence and aggression and even hatred. It may keep the peace, not allowing
            people to interact with one another, yet it still highlights and emphasizes the divide

            some of the images, especially images 2, 4  &amp;  5.
         </li>
         <li>Question 6: What aspects do you dislike?:  I dislike graffiti in general, because
            it is a form of vandalism, even if it looks kind of nice.
         </li>
         <li>Question 7a: Does the graffiti make you feel any certain type of emotion?:  Yes</li>

         <li>Question 10: What do you think of the words that are written on or around the graffiti?:
            I don't give a fuck about what they say. Like I said before, it's vandalism.

         <li>Question 12: What do you know about the Troubles in Northern Ireland?:  A Moderate
            Amount

         <li>Question 14: What did you learn of the Troubles from the previous answers you selected
            above?:  People dying, bombs exploding, tensions between Ireland and the UK, tensions
            between Catholics and Protestants, all that kind of stuff.
         </li>
         <li>Question 15: What do you now think of the depictions on Peace Wall?:  They pretty
            much give the impression that there are still some tensions going on in Belfast.
         </li>
         <li>Question 16: In your opinion, should there be a Peace Wall?  Why or why not?:  I don't
            think there should be a Peace Wall. As seen in the images, people are drawing graffiti
            all over the wall. In some cases, walls can also divide communities, as seen with
            the Berlin Wall. If Belfast is to become more peaceful, a wall is gonna do nothing.
            It's up to the people of Belfast to make that happen.

            above?:  The IRA were involved and so was religion. 
         </li>
         <li>Question 15: What do you now think of the depictions on Peace Wall?:  Some are pretty
            but most do not depict peace at all.
         </li>
         <li>Question 16: In your opinion, should there be a Peace Wall?  Why or why not?:  Yes

         <li>Question 16: In your opinion, should there be a Peace Wall?  Why or why not?:  Why
            not I suppose? If people don't write stuff there, they will find other places to vent
            and write how the feel about the situation.. Although in saying that, a 'wall' is
            indicative of separation, not peace and unity, which is quite contradictory, a 'peace
            wall'. But if its there already, taking it down may cause offence. And a peace symbol
            is oka

         <li>Question 16: In your opinion, should there be a Peace Wall?  Why or why not?:  yes
            - why not! These people have been through a lot and have continued to be segregated!!
            The peace wall should not be to block the communities but to bring them together.
            not like the Berlin wall.. more profound with more reason to commemorate those who
            died in the troubles.

            Through history we as humans have always built walls to keep a part two groups and
            it never works. Example of these border barriers include the Great Wall of China and
            the Berlin Wall. In modern times we still have walls - West Bank Wall for example.
            Separating these groups only reinforces differences and increase tensions between
            the gorups

         <li>Question 16: In your opinion, should there be a Peace Wall?  Why or why not?:  I think
            a peace wall is a good idea and should be there for people to write messages of hope
            or empowerment on but if it is going to be used for people to write messages of hate
            then it shouldn't be. I think the peace wall seems alright so it probably should be
            there. I think people like it.
